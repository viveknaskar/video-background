            <p>Coding is what makes it possible for us to create computer software, apps and websites. Your browser, your OS, the apps on your phone, Facebook, and this website, they are all made with code.</p>

            <h2>Why Do We Have So Many Programming Languages?</h2>
            <p>Because different languages are designed to be used for different purposes – some are useful for web development, others useful for writing desktop software, others useful for solving scientific and numeric problems, and so on.</p>

            <h2>What Happens When You Run a Program?</h2>
            <p>A computer does not actually understand the phrase ‘Hello, world!’, and it doesn’t know how to display it on screen. It only understands on and off. So to actually run a command like print 'Hello, world!', it has to translate all the code in a program into a series of ons and offs that it can understand.</p>
